Interactive tools are invaluable in machine learning (ML) projects, especially when demonstrating model capabilities and gathering feedback. A sketchpad is an excellent example of such a tool, allowing users to draw and interact with models in real time. Gradio, an open-source library for building user interfaces for machine learning models, simplifies the creation of such tools.

This article will guide you through creating a sketchpad using Gradio, where the input is processed as a numpy array.
